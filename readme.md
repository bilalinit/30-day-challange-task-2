# Why is using AI Development Agents (like Gemini CLI) for repetitive setup tasks better for your growth as a system architect?
AI Development Agents, such as the Gemini CLI, significantly accelerate development workflows. Tasks that previously consumed considerable time, particularly repetitive ones, can now be executed rapidly, thereby enabling developers to concentrate on more innovative aspects of their work.

# Explain how the Nine Pillars of AIDD help a developer grow into an M-Shaped Developer.
The Nine Pillars of AIDD are essentially for building an M-shaped developer. They focus on having the developer dive deep and master one specific skill, making them a specialist, while also ensuring they pick up solid, practical skills across a wide range of other areas. it makes them specialized and incredibly versatile, meaning they can easily handle any type of project challenge and contribute effectively wherever they're needed.

# Why does Vibe Coding usually create problems after one week?
Vibe coding refers to coding without a plan or rules. writing code based on zero strategy or rules. It feels fast at first, but give it a week and everything falls apart. The project turns into a mess, logic gets confusing and features start falling apart because there’s no actual structure holding it up.

# How would Specification-Driven Development prevent those problems?
Specification-Driven Development basically means you’re building with a strict game plan. you write down a solid plan covering every detail. Since you do all the thinking before writing a single line of code, your code comes out looking structured and works without any problems.

# How does architecture-first thinking change the role of a developer in AIDD?
Architecture-first thinking is the shift from just writing code to actually engineering a system. Instead of just writing raw code, you focus on the structure and how everything works together. it makes the project much easier for you since you structured the whole plan from the start, and it makes using AI agents 10x easier because they work on your defined structure.

# Explain why developers must think in layers and systems instead of raw code.
Thinking in layers lets you break a huge project into small manageable pieces, so the code is actually easy to handle. If you only focus on raw code, everything gets mix up , and you end up with a project that's incredibly difficult to fix or upgrade.
