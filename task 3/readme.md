# What new improvements were introduced in Gemini 3.0?
The new Gemini 3.0 introduced a variety of improvements that are useful for coding and day-to-day tasks. Some of which are "state of the art reasoning" that allows the model to have a better understanding of the context and enables it to be very human with its reasoning. "Deep-think" mode that allows the new model to easily navigate through complex tasks. The model is designed to be logical more than emotional so it will be more direct and up front with its answers.

# How does Gemini 3.0 improve coding & automation workflows?
It handles coding tasks much better because of multimodel understanding and agentic workflow, even if you don't explain every technical detail. it’s designed to be more independent, it can plan out multi-step solutions and actually use tools, like a browser or terminal, to run and test its own code to see if it works.

# How does Gemini 3.0 improve multimodal understanding?
It’s much better at connecting different types of information text, video, audio, and images all at once. It can now apply its "Deep Think" reasoning directly to video and audio content, allowing it to understand relationships and explain why actions are happening rather than just describing the scene your self.

# Name any two developer tools introduced with Gemini 3.0.
1. Antigravity: an agentic AI based IDE with its internal browser to work better in tasks like web development
2. genUI sdk: It allows the AI to have interactive widgets which can make the text based experience more enjoyable
